# This script waits for all snap operations on a remote device to complete.
# It uses SSH to query the snap changes on the device and checks for any ongoing operations.
# The script will retry up to 40 times, with a 30-second sleep between each attempt.
#
# Dependencies:
#     This script depends on SSH and assumes that SSH options and DEVICE_IP are set.
#
# Usage:
#     Run directly:
#     `wait_for_snap_complete <command> [command_args ...]`
#     Or source it in another script and call
#     `wait_for_snap_complete_function`
